        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Milo's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2016</strong> - Milo was born sometime around March.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - First outing with the family and we went hiking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - Became a menace and started terrorizing the neighbor's chickens and
            also started playfully chasing the cats around the house.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2019</strong> - We got another dog so Milo could have a companion
            and now two of them are terrorizing the neighbor's chickens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - When the pandemic started, Milo kept me company and his constant presence during
            that time really helped me cope with all that's happening around me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2021</strong> - At this point, almost everyone around the neighborhood knew who Milo was because
            he likes to roam around the neighborhood but never strays too far and never stays out for more than an hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2022</strong> - We took Milo to another one of our family outings and this time, we went to a river
            where we let him swim and run around the place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023</strong> - Some time around June, Milo unexpectedly contracted parvo virus and died after a week of
            trying and doing our best to save him.
          </li>
        </ul>
